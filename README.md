# Logistic-Regression - It is a classification algorithm which is used to predict a binary outcome from a linear combination of predictor variables.
In this, Firstly  we have to import our dataset,

then we have to check the null values present in the data,

then we have to do some exploratory data analysis to check the relationships in the data,

next we have to check the outliers present in the data by boxplotting,

then we have to perform preprocessing with the help of Label Encoder,

then we have to split the data into training and testing part,

then we have to Logistic Regression algorithm to find the accuracy of the model.
